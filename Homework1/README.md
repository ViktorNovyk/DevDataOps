# Homework 1

## Assignment

Using **Terraform**, complete the following tasks:

1. Create three resources:
    - An S3 bucket
    - An RDS instance (or another resource of your choice)
    - A virtual machine (VM)

2. Configure the Terraform state to be stored in **S3**.

3. Include execution logs for the following commands:
    - `terraform init`
    - `terraform plan`
    - `terraform apply`
    - `terraform destroy`

4. Share the project via a **public GitHub repository link**.

## Terraform Execution Logs
Execution logs are stored in the [`logs`](logs) directory:

- [Init Log](logs/1_init.md)
- [Plan Log](logs/2_plan.md)
- [Apply Log](logs/3_apply.md)
- [Destroy Log](logs/4_destroy.md)

## Terraform Project Structure

- **`backend.hcl`**  
  Defines the configuration for the remote backend (stored in S3).

- **`variables.tf`**  
  Declares the variables used throughout the project.

- **`terraform.tfvars`**  
  Provides values for the variables, specified during `plan`, `apply`, and `destroy` executions.

- **`providers.tf`**  
  Configures the providers (AWS in this case).

- **`main.tf`**  
  Defines the infrastructure resources, including an S3 bucket, DynamoDB table, and EC2 instance.

- **`.terraform.lock.hcl`**  
  Automatically generated by Terraform during the `init` execution to ensure consistent provider versions.
